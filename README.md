# PlantProject
Creating an arduino/rpi communication to monitor and water plants.

# Stuff i want to implement for sure
* Arduino & rPI serial communication
* A database to store data about watering times, moisture levels and time of the day
* A 5v pump powered by the arduino to water the plants with a tube
* A moisture sensor to measure the plant's moisture levels to generate data and optimize the water supplied so the plant doesn't die

# Nice to haves
* Google weather connection to get data based on daily sun and watering.
* Some kind of webhost to control manual watering
* Webpage to see stats and interact with them (possibly on an external host)
* Multiple plants support
