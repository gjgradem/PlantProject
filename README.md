# PlantProject
Creating an arduino/rpi communication to monitor and water plants.

# Stuff i want to implement for sure
* Arduino & rPI serial communication :white_check_mark:
* A database to store data about watering times, moisture levels and time of the day :white_check_mark:
* A 5v pump powered by the arduino to water the plants with a tube :white_check_mark:
* A moisture sensor to measure the plant's moisture levels to generate data and optimize the water supply so the plant doesn't die :white_check_mark:
* A google firebase database to store the data :white_check_mark:


# Nice to haves
* Google weather connection to get data based on daily sun and watering.
* Some kind of webhost to control manual watering
* Webpage to see stats and interact with them (possibly on an external host)
* Multiple plants support

# Extra's if I have enough time
* Application to monitor the plant (ionic?)
* Functionality to manually water the plant
* Extra pumping system for plant supplements with automation or manual triggers
